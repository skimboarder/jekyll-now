# Week 1 of spring 2018
It's been a week since I've been back at RIT now. I've started my final first week in college, with this hopefully being my last year. While attempting to select courses I stumbled across a seemingly great one, Humanitarian  Foundations of Open Source Software. 

So far the class seems great. Currently our only assignment is something called "first flight". This assignment involves a number of activities to help us students get acclimated  with the class. Of the assigned tasks, I have obtrained a client to interact with the IRC channel. My selection was Thunderbird (Yes, the mailing app!). I've used this application for years now to manage my emails, chats, and calendar. I've subscribed to the required mailing list, and I am not attempting my blog post. So far I still need to complete the github assignments. I have an image selected for my avatar but I have no other portions started. 

I'm excited to continue this course and can't wait to see what comes of it.
