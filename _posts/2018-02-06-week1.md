# Week 3 of spring 2018
This was a pretty slow week for me, especially for programming. Homework in my classes started popping up, and I spent
most of my days getting my assignments completed. I was still able to squeeze some time in for fun, and watched a video about
the 30th anniversary of the Foundation of Free Software. It provided some good examples of why free software is necessary in the modern world.
I also got to watch the SuperBowl over the weekend, and saw the Eagles pull out an unexpected win against the Patriots. I spent most of my 
weekend cooking food to eat while watching the game. I made some pulled pork, chili, and monkey bread, which I personally feel all came out great!
I hope the coming weeks provide some more oppurtunities to engage in software. My upcoming games are to continue development on a web project
I am working on with a few freinds, as well as furthering my skills with Augmented Reality development.
