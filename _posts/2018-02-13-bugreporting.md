# Litreview - Bug Reporting

I'm no stranger to bug reporting. The first co-op that I went on, my position was as an Automated Engineer. This meant I had a constant
interaction with both developers and QA throughout the day. The only was I was able to communicate effectively with both teams, was through
clear and concise bug reporting. Before having worked in this position, I used to never understand the importance of properly recording
the issue behind a bug. Since I have this recent appreciation for bug reporting, I was excited to read Simon Tatham's post on "How to Report Bugs Effectively" (https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/bugs.html). While it was written quite a while ago in 1999, it 
still provides a great deal of relevant information in todays world. 

Tatham does an excellent job of explaining the importance of detailed bug reporting. He goes over the things that make a report helpful,
as well as things that can distract a developer. Any developer has some benefit to gain from reading this article. 

One thing I really enjoyed about the article is Tathams discussion on bringing the developer over to your machine. I agree that the best
way for a developer to understand your issue, is to sit down to it. In all my attempts to show a bug to a collegue, the most successful
times are when they can sit down at my desk and play with my environment. 

I also really enjoyed the animal examples that Tatham provided. The idea that a user experiencing an error should freeze like a gazelle in 
danger is perfect. Too often have I seen someone just click away at messages or try to fix their issue and just end up in a worse scenario.
Usually this scenario is now even more difficult to debug and understand what happened. If more developers could ask for help before 
attempting to fix a problem, I think bug fixing would be a lot smoother. 

Finally, I also enjoyed Tathams request that developers be as specific as possible when filling out a bug report. The ambigous use of pronouns is a common problem that I have encountered. Things like providing the specific action taken can also help cut down on the time
a developer spends trying to replicate a bug. Reporting that the user tried to close a window is helpful, but knowing whether it was closed witha hotkey command or via the dialog window is just as important. 

There are also a few things I would have liked to see in the artile that were missing. My main request would be asking for a bug report template. A simple outline that readers could copy and paste in their bug reports would make all the difference in this article. 
I would also have liked to see a few examples of both good and bad bug reports to give readers an idea of what makes one better. 

Overall this article was a great read. It could provide informative to developers of all skill levels, and I would even recommend that
every developer give it a read. I know that I'm a better teammeber having read it.
