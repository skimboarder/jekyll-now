# Week 4 of spring 2018
This week I started my search for open source software to help me in my Archaeological Sciences project. As I mentioned in a previous post,
I am required to complete a semester project for the course. My plan is to do something related to programming, and my hope is that I will be able
to construct an Augmented Reality app. I'm interested in implementing some of the things that I've learned in my Foundations of Open Source 
Software class, and would like to use Free and Open Source Software for this assignment. In order to complete this project, I will require the use of some software that is capable of mapping 3d models from images. My initial plan was to work with several images of the location I wanted to model, 
and find some software that could turn those images into a functioning 3d model. After some searching, it seemed to be a challenge to find any open source software that met my requirements. I eventually reworked what I was looking for, and came across a project called MapTK. This open source project aims to use satellite imagery to form point cloud maps of a region. While I am not sure if it will exactly as I need for my use case, it looks close enough that I am willing to give it a shot to try and finish what I need. Over the next few weeks I'll be experimenting with this project to see
if it can accomplish what I need for my project idea.
