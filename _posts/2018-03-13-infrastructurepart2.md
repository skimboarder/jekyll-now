### LitReivew - Sofware Infrastructure ###

For this litreview, I finished reading over the text "Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind our Digital Infrastructure" (https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss/blob/master/assets/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure.pdf) by Nadia Eghbal.
The remainder of the book provided me with plenty of insight into my interaction with open source communities. Through the last 70 or so pages, Eghbal discusses the various challenges of maintaining an open source project. 
Open source projects have a difficult time attracting help, and there are plenty of obstacles that projects can encounter to make it even more difficult. 
The inability to provide adaquate compensation to developers in exchange for their hard work is a common cause for the decline of projects. While there has been an
increase in awareness and funding of projects at both an individual and corporate level, there is still a lot of progress that needs to be made in order to properly compensate open source developers.

One issue I particurally enjoyed reading about, was Eghbal's portion about the lack of concern for security in open source projects. Eghbal discusses the impact that several novice developers
beginning to contribute to a project has on its security. Eghbal argues that many new developers today don't have security in mind, and that the common culture around open-source isn't one that requires secure
practice in all contributions. Developers either unaware of the vulnerbilities they are introducing to a project or not caring about new exposures can cause plenty of trouble for project maintainers. 
I completely agree that developers today have a very minimal concern about security practices. Even as an RIT student majoring in Computer Science, I have not had a single course that even hints at secure coding practicies. 
This seems honestly unacceptable to me, and I have attempted to discuss with administrators things that can be done to change this. It seems, however, that the experience of a student is of little interest to the school. 
Eghbals portion on security concerns very much hit home to me, and I wish I had this text available to help form my arguments for the necessity of a required secure coding course at RIT.

I also enjoyed reading up on services like BountySource. I never knew something like this existed and I had to go check it out right away. It seems obvious now that a service like
this would exist. I expect to have plenty of free time over these next couple of months while waiting to start my full time position after graduation, and I plan to check out some bounties during that time!
I hope that after reading Eghbals section on these open source bounties, I'll be a little bit more aware about the impact I'm having on the open source community.

While discussing some of the problems that Eghbal feels arise with funding open source projects, one was named that I am an absolute culprit of. One of the biggest issues, Eghbal says, is that people believe the problem
of supporting open source projects has been solved. Until my time taking this course, I fell into that boat. I never really understood the culture and community revovling around open source. I knew that it was a grouping of developers
who enjoyed the ability to freely share their code, but never considered the costs of funding such projects. I knew there was a cost in terms of time for developers, and I figured that some of the largest contributors
for the largest projects had to be getting paid somehow.. I didn't know how or by who, but why would these developers put so much time and stress into these projects for only little or no compensation? It turns out I was very mistaken,
and there are actually countless developers who are passionate enough about their projects to work on them for free. After reading this book, however, I understand that while there are developers willing to volunteer their time,
there is always a level where they burn out and compensation needs to be awarded.
